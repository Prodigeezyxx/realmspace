## Phase 0 — Foundations already in place (audit)

| Capability | State |
|---|---|
| Next.js dashboard: landing, live, twin, ask, agents, report | ✅ |
| **Live on-device tracking** (TF.js + COCO-SSD + centroid tracker) | ✅ (real) |
| Python perception stub (YOLO + ByteTrack → JSON) | 🟡 stub |
| Docs: PRD, architecture, data-model, privacy, gtm | ✅ |
| Docs: vision, brand, roi, integrations, consent, event-bus, tenancy, competition | ✅ (this set) |
| Backend event bus (durable, Postgres) | ✅ (`backend/` — see Phase 1) |
| Backend graph / API beyond the bus | ✅ `POST /v1/sessions`, `GET /v1/sessions/{id}[/graph]` (Phase 2 prerequisite) |
| Dashboard wired to the backend | ✅ `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUS_URL` — WS in, `POST /events` out, wizard publishes config |
| Browser-side in-memory bus (live UI fan-out) | ✅ (`dashboard/src/lib/event-bus.ts`) |
| One-command local boot (`docker compose up`) | ✅ Postgres + Neo4j + backend, ~13s cold |
| DB-layer tenant isolation (Postgres RLS) | ✅ event log; ❌ graph (Neo4j Community can't) |

**Also parallel (founder-led, no code):** run the `gtm.md` validation sprint —
90s Loom + landing + 50 cold emails. **Pass = 5 booked demos in 7 days.**

## Phase 1 — The Spine (make the backend real) · ~2 weeks

*Goal: replace the mocked/in-memory backend with a real, replayable event bus +
graph, wired to the existing dashboard. Multi-tenant from the first commit.*

- ✅ FastAPI service + Postgres **append-only event bus** (`event-bus-spec.md`)
      — `backend/`; schema per §2, idempotent on `event_id`, cursor reads,
      tested against real Postgres. Nothing produces into it or consumes from
      it yet; `consumer_cursor` and `dead_letter` exist but are still inert.
- ✅ Graph store + schema from `data-model.md`; `tenant_id` everywhere
      (`multi-tenant.md`) — Neo4j (open decision #1 resolved in favour of the
      docs); `backend/app/graph/`. Schema covers 8 of the 9 node types, every
      key starting with `tenant_id`; migration runner; all Cypher confined to
      one repository module. `Frame` is unconstrained because `data-model.md`
      gives it no id to key on.
      **Caveat:** Community edition cannot enforce tenant isolation at the DB
      layer, so it is application-enforced — see `data-model.md` → "Store
      decision".
      Write functions exist for `Person`/`Zone`/`Session` and the `ENTERED` /
      `DWELLED_IN` edges — the subset the next item needs first. The remaining
      upserts and relationships land with the consumers that call them, rather
      than as code nothing exercises.
- ✅ Consumers: tracker, graph writer (edge, real-time) — `backend/app/consumers/`.
      Both run as tasks in the API process and are reported by `/health`.
      Tracker emits `spatial.zone_enter` / `zone_exit` / `dwell`;
      `gaze` / `group` / `passby` are not built (gaze needs pose data perception
      doesn't emit; passby is P2 per the blind-spots table below).
      Replay is a proven no-op — derived event ids plus `on_replay` state
      clearing, both verified by deliberately breaking them.
- ✅ WebSocket: bus → dashboard `/live` — `WS /v1/ws/{tenant_id}/{session_id}`,
      path and envelope matching the other track so POD 3 integrates once.
      `since_seq` is a real cursor, so a reconnect has no gap and no duplicates.
      **Measured 58ms median / 175ms worst** against the <500ms target.
      Swapping `/live` over to it is POD 3's job; perception → bus is the next
      item, so the feed carries HTTP-posted events until then.
- ✅ Harden perception stub: emit into bus, **offline buffer + replay** —
      `perception/bus_client.py` (ported from the `postgres-track`, plus auth and
      the frame dimensions the tracker needs) wired into `realmspace.py` behind
      `--bus-url`. Kill the backend mid-run and events buffer to a local JSONL;
      restart it and they replay oldest-first. **Verified: 11 events posted
      across an outage → 11 rows, 11 distinct ids, in order.** The `event_id` is
      assigned when the event happens, not when it is sent, which is what makes
      the reconnect idempotent rather than duplicating.
- ✅ Auth resolves user → org → role (RBAC skeleton) — `backend/app/auth/`.
      JWT for people, API keys for devices (a camera cannot log in), both signed
      and verified locally so the edge box still authenticates with no network.
      **`tenant_id` is now derived from the credential, not supplied**: the
      query parameter is gone, cross-tenant writes are refused, and the socket
      checks the path against the token. Week 1 1.6's outcome — "cross-tenant
      read fails" — holds at the application layer.
      **Not yet:** Postgres row-level security (1.6's stated mechanism, next
      item — and it can only cover the Postgres half, since Neo4j Community has
      no equivalent), and `POST /v1/auth/token` still trusts the email it is
      given rather than verifying a Firebase login.

**Acceptance:** real camera → real event in Postgres log → real graph node → real
`/live` KPI, tenant-scoped, works offline then replays on reconnect. `< 500ms`
detection → dashboard.

---

## Phase 2 — Prove ROI (the #1 client job) · ~2 weeks

*Goal: turn the report into a real, defensible ROI proof. This is the wedge.*

- ✅ **Prerequisite: session configuration API** — `POST /v1/sessions` +
      `GET /v1/sessions/{id}` + `/graph` (`backend/app/routers/sessions.py`).
      Not on the original Phase 2 list because it belongs to the seam between
      the phases: Phase 1 shipped `upsert_zone` with no caller outside the tests,
      so a real deployment had no zones, the tracker returned early on every
      detection, and nothing downstream had anything to measure. Also carries the
      measurement parameters `roi-framework.md` §5 wants set before the
      activation runs — zone weights, funnel order, engagement threshold,
      activation cost, attribution model. Zone edits invalidate the tracker's
      cache through a new `session.zones_updated` event.
- ✅ **Prerequisite: dashboard ↔ backend wiring** — `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUS_URL` turns on
      a WebSocket feed in (mirrored into the durable local log, `since_seq`
      cursor so a reconnect has no gap), `POST /events` out (buffered in the
      local log across an outage, replayed in order), the wizard publishing to
      `POST /v1/sessions`, and a connection pill. `dashboard/src/lib/bus/`.
      Also the payload translation the two contracts need: the bus pins
      snake_case for the Python producers, this app's contract is camelCase, and
      the mismatch was silent — an untranslated dwell scores as `NaN` plus a
      phantom visitor rather than raising. Tested against a verbatim capture of
      real backend output.
- ✅ Report templated from **real session data** — `/report` renders for every
      session, not only the demo, and every figure traces to an event in the log
      or to a parameter the operator set. The hand-written cover numbers
      (`1,287 visitors`, `4.2×`, four invented recommendations) are gone.
- ✅ **4-layer scorecard** wired to real data — the `DEMO` fallback and the
      hardcoded `activationCost`/`revenueInfluenced` that made the headline ROI
      fiction are deleted. Anything uncomputable renders as `—` **and names what
      is missing**, because "we don't know" and "zero" are different answers.
- ✅ Signature metrics: dwell-weighted attention (per-zone weights from the
      session config), engagement rate (against the configured threshold),
      funnel (in the operator's declared order, never sorted by traffic), CPEV.
      Two definitions corrected against `roi-framework.md` §2 in the process:
      footfall now counts entry-zone crossings rather than anyone entering any
      zone, and returns null when no entry zone is configured; peak concurrency
      is renamed to peak *zone* occupancy, which is what it measures.
      **ROI ratio needs influenced revenue**, which nothing measures until Phase
      4 — it is an optional operator-supplied figure, labelled as the client's
      own on every surface, and blank rather than estimated when absent.
- ✅ **The two missing signals.** Pass-by (Reach) is emitted by the tracker at
      track close-out — one per person per zone, cancelled outright by entering.
      Surface interactions (Engagement) have their whole path built: wizard
      touchpoints become `Surface` nodes, `graph_writer` draws
      `INTERACTED_WITH`, and `trigger_count` survives replay. **No producer was
      invented** — real interactions need booth hardware, so the figure stays a
      marked zero until something POSTs one. Also `session.ended`, without which
      the visitors still in the room at close were never counted at all.
- ✅ **Live ROI tile on the dashboard (day-2 optimisation)** — and the bigger
      thing it exposed: `/live` never read the event bus at all. Every figure
      came from the browser's own webcam tracker or a mock file, so an
      activation fed the way the backend was built for showed nothing. The KPI
      strip now reads the durable log first, the detector second, an honest
      empty third. The tile renders the *same* `Scorecard` the report does, so
      an operator cannot optimise against a number their client will never see.
      Invented deltas (`+2 in last 5m`, `+18 last hour`, `+12% wk`) removed on
      the same grounds as the report's.
- 🔲 **Ask the Room** real: LLM → constrained Cypher (allow-list, validated) →
      graph → answer (replace regex mocks). *Needs AI provider key.*
- ✅ Twin plays back **recorded** sessions from the bus — `lib/twin/replay.ts`
      builds paths from the log; positions come from `perception.detection`
      bboxes where they exist and from **zone centres** where they do not, with
      the two rendered and labelled differently because a line between two zone
      centres is not a route anybody walked. Real session bounds replace the
      620-second constant, and the `!isDemo && !detectorRunning` gate is gone —
      it meant a recorded session, the thing the twin exists for, could never be
      replayed. The twin pages `GET /events` itself rather than going through the
      5,000-event local ring buffer, which a real session would overflow.

**Acceptance:** 24h after a session, a client gets a data-true report with the
4-layer scorecard and a stated ROI ratio vs. benchmark; Ask answers a live
question in `< 5s`; twin replays a real recorded session.

---

## Phase 3 — Act: Rules Engine + Staff Prompts · ~1.5 weeks

*Goal: turn signals into real-time action (the "Next-Step" surface), anonymous.*

- 🔲 Persist agent rules (Postgres); rules-engine consumer on the bus
- 🔲 Real actions: Slack / webhook / screen swap / **staff prompt** (< 3s SLA)
- 🔲 HITL **dead-letter review** screen for failed actions
- 🔲 **Cost telemetry** meter (`cost.metered` → unit economics)

**Acceptance:** "when 5 people dwell at entrance 30s → ping Slack" fires live in
`< 3s`; a forced failure lands in the HITL queue and can be retried.

---

## Phase 4 — Attribute: Lead Capture + Consent + CRM · ~2–3 weeks

*Goal: bridge anonymous behaviour to identified pipeline, with consent, into any
CRM. This is where "Attribute & Follow up" fully switches on — as new bus
consumers, without touching Phase-1 producers.*

- 🔲 **Consent capture** surfaces (badge/QR/kiosk/form) → `consent.captured`
      (`consent-and-identity.md`) with versioned copy + tiers/redlines
- 🔲 **Identity consumer**: consent-gated anon → Contact link (anon+PII modes)
- 🔲 **Attribution consumer**: build normalized **LeadHandoff**, apply
      model + window (`integrations.md`, `roi-framework.md`)
- 🔲 **CRM adapters** in order: HubSpot → Salesforce → Pipedrive → Zoho →
      Dynamics; each idempotent, retract-capable
- 🔲 **Bring-your-own**: signed webhook + Zapier/Make + CSV export
- 🔲 Withdrawal / erasure flows (re-anonymise, `crm.retract`)
- 🔲 (opt, T3) enrichment adapter (Apollo/Clearbit), metered
- 🔲 **Attribution ledger** + **CFO one-pager** (`roi-framework.md`)

**Acceptance:** a consented badge scan produces a Contact linked to its spatial
path, a LeadHandoff lands in HubSpot with spatial_intent fields, a withdrawal
retracts it, and the attribution ledger reconciles booth-touch → outcome.

---

## Phase 5 — Follow-up automation + Intelligence · ~2 weeks

*Goal: close the loop with contextual follow-up and smarter agents.*

- 🔲 **Contextual SDR** draft agent (path-aware follow-up emails, consent ≥ T2)
- 🔲 Live Analyst agent (NL queries over the live bus)
- 🔲 Floor orchestrator (predict density, staff allocation) — if demand proven
- 🔲 LLM insight generation every N minutes → `insight.generated`

**Acceptance:** post-session, a consented lead receives a draft follow-up
referencing the exact zones/surfaces they engaged; analyst answers live NL queries.

---

## Phase 6 — Platform hardening (public product) · ~2 weeks

*Goal: the things required to sell to the public at scale.*

- 🔲 **Multi-tenant** isolation hardened + RBAC complete (`multi-tenant.md`)
- 🔲 **Cloud replay sync** (anonymised) + **cross-activation benchmark** dataset
- 🔲 **Billing** hooks (Stripe) + plan metering/limits
- 🔲 Calibration UI + **CV drift telemetry**; multi-camera fusion
- 🔲 **Brand re-token** UI to the brand book (Sora/Inter/IBM Plex Mono, orange
      `#FF5C00` / teal `#00D4AA` / base `#0A0B10`) — `brand.md`
- 🔲 Deploy pipeline, exports, onboarding polish

**Acceptance:** a third-party operator self-serves signup → activation → report,
fully isolated, billed, on-brand.

## Blind spots → living engineering tickets

From the founder architecture dump; each is designed-for, not hoped-for:

| Blind spot | Where it's handled |
|---|---|
| Offline / edge reliability | `event-bus-spec.md` §5 (local log + replay) — P1 |
| Latency SLA (< 3s) | edge-run rules engine — P3 |
| CV model drift | calibration UI + drift telemetry — P6 |
| Failure states (CRM 429, consent revoked) | dead-letter + HITL, withdrawal flow — P3/P4 |
| Attribution decay (30/60/90d) | window on outcome edge — P4 |
| Multi-booth / cross-event aggregation | multi-tenant benchmark — P6 |
| Cost telemetry / unit economics | `cost.metered` meter — P3 |
| Group visits | `Group` node (in `data-model.md`) — P1/P2 |
| Negative signals (pass-by/skip) | ✅ `spatial.passby` — tracker emits at close-out for a zone approached within `tracker_passby_radius` and never entered |
| Session hygiene (boundary flicker, track dropout, sub-second dwells) | ✅ confirm window + dropout sweep + minimum dwell in `consumers/tracker.py`, ported from the postgres-track's `spatial-deriver.ts` (CHI '26: 71% of raw sessions invalid without them) |

---

## Open technical decisions (to confirm as we build)

1. **Graph store:** Neo4j (matches docs) vs. embedded SQLite/DuckDB graph for
   the edge box (lighter, offline-friendly). *Lean: decide at start of P1.*
2. **AI provider:** OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini for Ask + SDR. *Still open as of
   2026-08-03.* No key exists in the repo. Ask the Room is therefore sequenced
   **last** in P2 rather than blocking it — nothing else in the phase needs a
   provider, so the report, scorecard, ROI tile and twin replay proceed without
   one. Ask stays on its regex mocks until this is decided.
3. **First CRM confirmed:** HubSpot as reference adapter (P4).
4. **Repo:** continue on `genspark_ai_developer` in the main `realmspace` repo.
